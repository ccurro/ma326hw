Let $\mathsf{V}$ be a vector space having dimension $n$, and let $S$
be a subset of $\mathsf{V}$ that generates $\mathsf{V}$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Prove that there is subset of $S$ that is a basis for
  $\mathsf{V}$. (Be careful not to assume that $S$ is finite.)
\item Prove that $S$ contains at least $n$ vectors.
\end{enumerate}
