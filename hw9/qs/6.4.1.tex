Label the following statements as true or false. Assume the underlying
inner product spaces are finite-dimensional.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every self-adjoint operator is normal.

{\bf True}

\item Operators and their adjoints have the same eigenvectors.

{\bf False}

\item If $\mathsf{T}$ is an operator on an inner product space
  $\mathsf{V},$ then $\mathsf{T}$ is normal if and only if
  $[\mathsf{T}]_\beta$ is normal, where $\beta$ is any ordered basis
  for $\mathsf{V}.$

{\bf False}

\item A real or complex matrix $A$ is normal if and only if
  $\mathsf{L}_A$ is normal.

{\bf True}

\item The eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator must be real.

{\bf True}

\item The identity and zero operators are self-adjoint.

{\bf True}

\item Every normal operator is diagonalizable.

{\bf False}

\item Every self-adjoint operator is diagonalizable. 

{\bf True}
\end{enumerate}
