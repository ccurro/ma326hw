Label the following statements as true or false. Assume that the
underlying inner product spaces are finite-dimensional.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every unitary operator is normal.

{\bf True}
\item Every orthogonal operator is diagonalizable.

{\bf False}
\item A matrix is unitary if and only if it is invertible.

{\bf False}
\item If two matrices are unitarily equivalent, then they are also
  similar.

{\bf True}

\item The sum of unitary matrices is unitary.

{\bf False}
\item The adjoint of a unitary operator is unitary.

{\bf True}
\item If $\mathsf{T}$ is an orthogonal operator on $\mathsf{V},$ then
  $[\mathsf{T}]_\beta$ is an orthogonal matrix for any ordered basis
  $\beta$ for $\mathsf{V}.$ 

{\bf False}
\item If all the eigenvalues of a linear operator are 1, then the
  operator must be unitary or orthogonal.

{\bf False}
\item A linear operator may preserve the norm, but not the inner
  product.

{\bf False}
\end{enumerate}
