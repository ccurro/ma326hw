Let $\phi(x)$ and $f(x)$ be polynomials. If $\phi(x)$ is irreducible
and $\phi(x)$ does not divide $f(x),$ then $\phi(x)$ and $f(x)$ are
relatively prime.

Claim: Let $\phi(x)$ and $f(x)$ be polynomials. If $\phi(x)$ is
irreducible, and $\phi(x)$ does not divide $f(x)$, then $\phi(x)$ and
$f(x)$ are relatively prime.

\paragraph{}
Because $\phi(x)$ is irreducible, $f(x)$ does not divide
$\phi(x)$. Since $\phi(x)$ does not divide $f(x)$ it follows that
$\phi(x)$ and $f(x)$ are relatively prime.
