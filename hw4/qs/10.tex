Prove or give a counterexample to the following statement: If the
coefficient matrix of a system of $m$ linear equation in $n$ unknowns
has rank $m$, then the system has a solution.
\\Suppose $A\in \mathsf{M}_{m\times n}(F)$ and $\rank{A}=m$
\\Since $\rank{A}=m$ it follows that
\begin{equation}
\rank{A|b} = m\quad \text{for } b \in \mathsf{M}_{m\times 1}
\end{equation}
It follows that $Ax=b$ is consistent since $\text{rank}(A|b) =
\rank{A}$ by theorem 3.11.
