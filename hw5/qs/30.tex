Let the rows of $A \in \M{n}{n}{F}$. be $a_1,a_2,\dotsc,a_n$ and let
$B$ be the matrix in which the rows are
$a_n,a_{n-1},\dotsc,a_1$. Calculate $\dete{B}$ in terms of $\dete{A}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf $\mathbf{n}$ is even}
\paragraph{}In $A$, swap
\begin{align}
a_{n-1} &\text{ with } a_1\\
 a_{n-2} &\text{ with } a_2\\
\notag&\vdots\\
 a_{n-\frac{n}{2}+1} &\text{ with } a_{n-\frac{n}{2}}
\end{align}
From the fact that $\mfrac{n}{2}$ swaps were performed it follows from
Theorem 4.6 that
\begin{equation}
\dete{B} = (-1)^\frac{n}{2} \dete{A} 
\end{equation}
\item {\bf $\mathbf{n}$ is odd}
In $A$, swap 
\begin{align}
a_{n-1} &\text{ with } a_1\\
 a_{n-2} &\text{ with } a_2\\
\notag&\vdots\\
 a_{n-\frac{n+1}{2}+1} &\text{ with } a_{n-\frac{n+1}{2}}
\end{align}
From the fact that $n-\frac{n+1}{2}$ swaps were performed it follows
from Theorem 4.6 that
\begin{equation}
\dete{B} = (-1)^{\frac{n-1}{2}}\dete{A}
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
