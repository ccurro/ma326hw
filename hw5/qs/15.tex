Prove the corollary to Theorem 3.16: The reduced row echelon form of a
matrix is unique. 
\paragraph{} Suppose $A \in \M{m}{n}{F}$ such that $\rank{A} = r
\leq\text{min}\{m,n\}$
\\Proof by induction 
\\Suppose $n=1$ 
\paragraph{Case 1}
\begin{equation}
A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
$A$ is in reduced row echelon form and this the unique representation.
\paragraph{Case 2}
\begin{equation}
A = \begin{pmatrix}a_{11}\\a_{21}\\\vdots\\A_{m1}\end{pmatrix} \quad
\text{for some } a_{i1} \neq 0
\end{equation}
\paragraph{} Execute the following sequence of row operations on
$A$. Perform type 1 row operation to move $a_{i1}$ to the first
row. Perform type 3 row operations to eliminate all lower
terms. Perform type 2 row operation to the change the first term in
the column to 1.
\begin{equation}
A \leadsto \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\\vdots\\0\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The reduced row echelon form of a column must be of this form. It
follows that this matrix is the unique row reduced echelon form.
