Prove the following refinement of Theorem 6.37(d).
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $0 < \text{rank}A < n$ and $A$ has no negative eigenvalues,
  then $f$ has no local maximum at $p.$
\item If $0 < \text{rank}A < n$ and $A$ has no positive eigenvalues,
  then $f$ has no local minimum at $p.$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Because the matrix $A$ does not have full rank at least 1 of the
  eigenvalues of $A$ is equal to zero. Therefore some of the
  eigenvalues are positive while some are zero. Futhermore because the
  rank of $A$ is greater than zero at least one non-zero eigenvalue
  is guarenteed. Without loss of
  generality  assume that $p=0.$ Taking from the proof for Theorem
  6.37 in the book 
\begin{equation}
f(0) = 0 \leq \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{1}{2}\lambda_i - \epsilon
\right)s_i^2 < f(x)
\end{equation}
It follows that because there is at least one non-zero eigenvalue that
the sum in the above inequality is greater than zero. Therefore
$f(x)$ is greater than $f(0)=0$ around $0.$ Therefore there is no
local maximum at $0.$
